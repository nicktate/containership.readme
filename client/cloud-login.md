# cloud login

    Usage: containership cloud login <scm>

    Login with an `scm` that you have registered through ContainerShip Cloud.

The supported \`scm\` arguments are currently \`github\` and \`bitbucket\`. 



## Examples

```
containership configure use mycluster
```

This will update your client configuration file at `~/.containership/cli-config-v2.json` to include the `activeCluster` attribute set to the provided cluster.

```
{
  ...
  "activeCluster": "mycluster",
  ... 
}
```
