### What is an organization?
In ContainerShip Cloud, organizations allow you to partition your clusters into logical groups. Organizations also act as a billing which are subscribed to certain billing & support plans.

Having multiple organizations is helpful when using ContainerShip Cloud to work on unrelated projects. Your ContainerShip Cloud account can be associated with an unlimited number of organizations.
